# Changelog

## [0.19.0] - 2023-08-05

### Added
- The TREx-RGB loader, `asilib.asi.trex_rgb()`, courtesy of C. McKenna.
- `asilib.asi.trex_rgb()` tests
- `Conjunction.lla_footprint` tests
- `asilib.asi.trex_rgb()` to the online documentation.

## Fixed
- A bug in `Imager.keogram()` that calculated the incorrect pixels that is used for slicing images when assembling a keogram. While this bug does not affect ASIs with square pixel resolution, it did for TREx-RGB which is rectangular. The fix slightly modified the keograms, by about a pixel, so I regenerated the baseline keogram plots.
- A bug in `Conjunction.lla_footprint` where the `alt` variable was rewritten. As a result, IRBEM did not map to the requested altitude.

## [0.18.1] - 2023-07-23

### Added
- `asilib.Imagers.get_points()` method to get the (lon, lat) and pixel intensity points.
- Tests for `asilib.Imagers.get_points()`

## [0.18.0] - 2023-07-22

### Added
- `asilib.Imagers()` class to make mosaics and synchronize plotting multiple imagers. The first two methods implemented are:
  - `asilib.Imagers.plot_fisheye()` to plot fisheye lens images from multiple imagers, and
  - `asilib.Imagers.plot_map()` to project images from multiple imagers onto a map. This method has an `overlap` kwarg that by default masks out the (lat, lon) skymaps that map to pixels that overlap with a neighboring imager. This is a surprisingly efficient method that needs to be run just once (tested for up to five imagers; I'm unsure how a 10 or a 20 imager array will fare).
- Added plot tests for the two `Imagers` methods.
- Added an `Imagers()` description in the Get Started and API pages.
### Changed
- Refactored the Donovan+2008 auroral arc example to use `asilib.Imagers.plot_map()`.
- Added a check to allow custom `matplotlib.colors.Normalization` object to be passed for `color_norm`.

## [0.17.3] - 2023-07-02

### Added
- Support for RGB images in `asilib.Imager.keogram()`.

### Changed
- Simplified `asilib.Imager.__getitem__()` to repay the technical debt. Before the method was difficult to reason about and it processed the [time] and [start_time:end_time] slice cases separately. Now `__getitem__` handles both of those cases in the same way.
- Simplified how the `Imager._keogram` array is allocated when `asilib.Imager.keogram()` is called.
- Edited the Imager flowchart.

## [0.17.2] - 2023-06-28 
### Added
- Deprecation warnings to the legacy asilib plotting functions and in the API reference. They will be removed in or after December 2023.

## [0.17.1] - 2023-06-28
### Changed
- Fixed the `color_norm` keyword argument in `asilib.Imager()` methods. Now it defaults to `None` so the normalization is correctly overridden. Also, the `color_norm` docstring is updated to clarify the hierarchy.
- Changed the `data` to `file_info` argument in `asilib.Imager()`, and all ASI loaders, to more clearly convey the purpose of the variable.

## [0.17.0] - 2023-06-24

### Added
- A tutorial using `asilib.Imager()`.
- Documentation in contribute.rst describing the `asilib.Imager()` interface. Simplified the `asilib.Imager().__init__()` docstring and point to the thorough interface description in the new Contribute section.

### Changed
- Refactored how `asilib.Imager()` deals with single- and multi-image instances. Now, each ASI `wrapper` function does not need to load a single image if `time` is specified, `asilib.Imager()` does this instead.
- Refactored the `themis`, `rego`, `trex_nir`, `lamp_phantom`, and `psa_emccd` wrapper functions with the new `asilib.Imager()` interface.
- Due to this change, the `asilib.Imager.__getitem__()` method significantly simplified.

## [0.16.2] - 2023-06-10

### Added
- Refactored all examples from `examples/v0/` and saved them in `examples/v1/`.
- Added the v1 examples to the Examples documentation tab. During the v0->v1 transition, users can see the examples in both the v0 and v1 interfaces.
- Removed experimental warning from Imager API Reference and moved it to the Legacy API Reference. 

## [0.16.1] - 2023-05-31

### Fixed
- The example in `examples/v1/animate_conjunction.py`.

### Changed
- Bumped the Calgary dependencies to avoid the freeze support multiprocessing bug for windows users
  - rego-imager-readfile>=1.2.0
  - themis-imager-readfile>=1.2.1
  - trex-imager-readfile>=1.4.0

## [0.16.0] - 2023-05-24

### Added
- TREx-NIR loader
- TREx-NIR API documentation with examples
- TREx-NIR tests 

### Fixed
- A bug in `asilib.Imager.keogram()`. If the data was already loaded (via the `.data` method), any subsequent calls to `asilib.Imager.keogram()` or `asilib.Imager.plot_keogram()` crashed.

### Changed
- ASI loader functions for `asilib.Imager()` should now be imported as:
```python
import asilib.asi

asi = asilib.asi.themis(...)
```

(old version is)
```python
import asilib

asi = asilib.themis(...)
```
## Version 0.15.0
- Finalizing the `asilib.Conjunction` API
- Added `asilib.Conjunction.intensity` method. Depending on if the `box` argument is specified or not, this method will calculate either the auoral intensity for the nearest pixel to the footprint (`box=None`) or in a rectangular area around the footprint otherwise (e.g., `box=(10x10)`).
- Added tests for `asilib.Conjunction.map_azel()`.
- Angular distances in `asilib.Conjunction.map_azel()` (and elsewhere) are now calculated using the _haversine equation.
- Moved original examples to `examples/v0/` folder and started writing the examples using `Imager()` and  `Conjunction()` to the `examples/v1/` folder.
## Version 0.14.4
- Updated GitHub Actions:
  - test the `cartopy` maps,
  - test using `ubuntu-latest`.

## Version 0.14.3
- The following `asilib.Imager` methods are now tested:
1. `plot_fisheye()`,
2. `plot_map()`,
3. `animate_fisheye()`,
4. `animate_map()`,
5. `plot_keogram()`,
6. `iter_files`,
7. `__getitem__`,
8. `__str__`, and
9. `__repr__`.

- The `asilib.themis()` and `asilib.rego()` examples are now tested as well.

- Fixed a `asilib.Imager` bug that was triggered when the time slicing is outside of the time_range. Before, it raised an unhelpful `AssertionError`, but now it raises an informative `FileNotFoundError`.

## Version 0.14.2
- Added a `asilib.asi.fake_asi` function to quickly test `asilib.Imager`. 
- Using the `fake_asi` I found and fixed a few errors in `asilib.Imager`.
- Added more tests for `asilib.asi.themis()`, `asilib.map.create_map()` and began adding tests for `asilib.Imager`.

## Version 0.14.1
- Added tests for `asilib.themis()` plotting functions
- Moved map creating examples to `asilib.map.create_map()`.
- Fixed numerous minor bugs in `asilib.Imager()`.

## Version 0.14.0
- Added `Imager.plot_map()`, `Imager.animate_map()`, `Imager.animate_map_gen()` methods and documentation that project images, or a series of images, onto a geographic map.
- Added `Imager.keogram()`, and `Imager.plot_keogram()` methods to make keograms
  - Along the meridian or a custom path
  - With geographic or magnetic latitudes, depending on the `aacgm` kwarg.
- `asilib.Imager` functionality is complete, with a first draft of the documentation & examples.

## Version 0.13.0
- Added an Active Development warning in the `asilib` docs.
- Simplified the `Downloader` class.
- Fixed a download bug. It arose because the `overwrite` kwarg played two overlapping roles: to redownload data and overwrite animations (the ffmpeg argument). I fixed the bug with the `redownload` kwarg reserved only for downloading data, and `overwrite` kwarg reserved for overwriting animations.
- Added cardinal directions to `asilib.imager.plot_fisheye()` and `asilib.imager.plot_fisheye_gen()` methods. To use it, set the `cardinal_directions` kwarg to one or more directions, e.g., 'NE' for north and east directions (default), or 'NEWS' for all directions.
- Improved the `asilib.Downloader` class. 
  - Replaced the `_check_url_status()` implementation that checked if the server is online. Turns out, if the url argument includes a path to a large file, `asilib.Downloader` will download the file just to check the server status. I replaced it with `request.raise_for_status()` that doesn't download the file.
  - Added a try-catch block for streaming large files. This addresses the bug where a file is partially-downloaded if the stream is interrupted. This goes unnoticed until `asilib` raises file-corrupted errors that are hard to track down. The fix first deletes the partially-downloaded file if the stream is interrupted, and then raises the error.
- Added functions, documentaion, and examples for `asilib.map.create_map()`, `asilib.map.create_cartopy_map()`, and `asilib.map.create_simple_map()` to use with `asilib.Imager`.

## Version 0.12.0
- First merge of the Imager class. The `asilib.Imager` and `asilib.Conjunction` classes are still under development, but you can try it out! Call the `asilib.themis()` function to play around with an Imager instance.
- Removed the deprecated functions. Once Imager is fully implemented, most of the original functions will be deprecated. 

## Version 0.11.0
- Removed the cartopy dependency. While some users were able to install it, overall it proved to be difficult to reliably build across multiple operating systems. Instead, I use the pyshp pure python library to read in the Esri shapefile files to make the map. Currently, only the mercator projection is supported. However, in the future, I plan to add other projections such as orthographic.
- Renamed asilib.create_cartopy_map() to asilib.make_map()

## Version 0.10.1
- Added a `path` kwarg to `keogram` and `plot_keogram` to create a keogram along a custom (lat, lon) path.
- Clarified the documentation.

## Version 0.10.0
- Added `animate_map` and `animate_map_generator` functions to asilib. I also added examples to the examples and tutorial sections of the docs. 
- Added a warning in `equal_area` if the lat/lon values are outside of the skymap range.

## Version 0.9.5
- Renamed and deprecated `plot_movie` and `plot_movie_generator` for `animate_fisheye` and `animate_fisheye_generator` functions. This change is necessary for consistency with new functions such as `animate_map` and `animate_map_generator` functions.
- Updated the examples.
- Combined the download functions to `download_image` and `download_skymap`.

## Version 0.9.3
- Renamed the `_make_map` function to `create_cartopy_map()` so users can use this function to create maps from now on.
- Updated the information in `CONTRIBUTE.md`.

## Version 0.9.2
- Fixed a bug where the `color_bounds` in `plot_movie_generator()` were static after the first image.
- Renamed and deprecated `plot_image` for `plot_fisheye`.

## Version 0.9.0
- Rotated the 2- and 3-D `skymap` arrays and fixed a bug in `keogram.py` where the skymap latitudes were a few pixels off.

## Version 0.8.0 
- Swapped the order of most functions to `asi_array_code, location_code, time`. This is a major API change that is not backwards-compatible. 
- Many edits the the docstrings.
- Renamed the example scripts and added example scripts for `plot_map`.
- Finished a first complete draft of tutorial.ipynb.

## Version 0.7.5
- Changed all instances of the word `station` and replaced it with `location_code`.

## Version 0.7.4
- The main change is the `ignore_missing_files` parameter that is passed to the download functions. When True, the `download_themis_img` and `download_rego_img` will not raise a missing file error when data from that hour does not exist.

## Version 0.7.3
- The biggest API change is the parameter order for `download_rego_img` and `download_themis_img`. Now it is `(location code (i.e. station), time, and time_range)`. Beware that now the parameter order API is inconsistent across all of the functions---I will standardize it to (`asi_array_code`, `location code (i.e. station)`, `time`, and `time_range`) in the next minor (0.X.0 release).

## Version 0.7.2
- For consistency, I removed most instances of the word "frame" and changed them to "image". This propagated to the following function renaming (deprecation of the old name).
- Deprecated the get_frame and get_frames functions for load_image. It is a wrapper for _load_image and _load_images functions that were once get_frame and get_frames. I added this function to standardize the load/download names. It returns either one or multiple images, depending on if the time or time_range keyword arguments are given; it will raise an error unless time or time_range is passed (not both).
- Renamed the plot_frame function to `plot_image`; plot_frame is now deprecated.

## Version 0.7.1
- Removed deprecated functions
